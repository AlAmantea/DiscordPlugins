# THIS IS A FALLBACK FILE CAUSED BY A BAD UPDATELINK
For those of you that arrived here; reinstall the plugin from here: https://github.com/Farcrada/DiscordPlugins/tree/master/Double-click-to-edit
Make sure you delete both `DoubleClickToEdit.plugin.js` and `AutoScaleTextAreaIcons.plugin.js` before installing.

~~It should automatically update, and aside from the filename it should not be that much different (I hope).~~
It seems I was wrong. This creates a conflict; but doing the above will fix it.

## If you are wondering
[...] why there's ~~these two quick updates~~ a crash/error it's to rectify a blunder I've made.

My deepest and sincerest apologies.
