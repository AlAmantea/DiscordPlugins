# THIS IS A FALLBACK FILE CAUSED BY A BAD UPDATELINK
For those of you that arrived here; update the plugin from here: https://github.com/Farcrada/DiscordPlugins/tree/master/Double-click-to-edit

It should automatically update, and aside from the filename it should not be that much different (I hope).

## If you are wondering
[...] why there's these two quick updates it's to rectify a blunder I've made.

My deepest and sincerest apologies.
