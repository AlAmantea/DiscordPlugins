Assuming you want this to be on discreetely, I have not added any buttons to "easily" disable the plugin unless actually on the plugin page. It will also not attempt to get any updates, in case your connection is being monitored. Who knows.

It's open to improvements such as toggles to allow updates or quick buttons to toggle, we'll see.
