# Hide NSFW Channels
Assuming you want this to be on discreetely, I have not added any buttons to "easily" disable the plugin unless actually on the plugin page. 
~~It will also not attempt to get any updates, in case your connection is being monitored. Who knows.~~ There was a request for including an updater so this is behind a session toggle. To renew a session, restart discord or press `Ctrl + R`.

## Right click to hide
You can selectively hide channels by rightclicking channels. If that channel is not tagged as NSFW by the server, then the option will not appear. Any issues regarding a missing NSFW flag should be discussed with your server owner, if that does not resolve the issue and you suspect the plugin, feel free to open an issue.
