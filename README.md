# Farcrada's Discord Plugin library
Greetings. I made plugins. Sometimes with all the bullshit torn out or just because the old one doesn't work like it used to.

# Requirements
These plugins require you to have (Bandaged) Better Discord installed: https://betterdiscord.net/home/ (Simply press the big ol' download button and then download the desired installer).

# Installation
Download the `.plugin.js` file and put it inside your plugins folder

## Plugins folder
- Press the cogwheel (bottom right) next to the microphone and headphone-icon;
- Go to `Plugins` at the bottom right;
- Click `Open Plugin Folder` at the top (file explorer can appear behind Discord itself, so check your taskbar);
- Put the `.plugin.js` file there.
