# Farcrada's Discord Plugin library
Greetings. I made plugins. Sometimes with all the bullshit torn out or just because the old one doesn't work like it used to.

# Requirements
These plugins require you to have (Bandaged) Better Discord installed: https://betterdiscord.app/ (Simply press the big ol' download button).

# Installation
Download the `.plugin.js` file and put it inside your plugins folder

## OldColours.css
This file is to revert to the old colours Discord replaced in the new update. Instead of installing some random theme that is basically just CSS and a link to some website, this bit of CSS you can simply paste in the `Custom CSS` page on your BD settings. Make sure to restart Discord after saving.

## Plugins folder
- Press the cogwheel (bottom left) next to the microphone and headphone-icon;
- Go to `Plugins` at the bottom right;
- Click `Open Plugin Folder` at the top (file explorer can appear behind Discord itself, so check your taskbar);
- Put the `.plugin.js` file there.
