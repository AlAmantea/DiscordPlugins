# Right Click Join
This plugin lets you right click a user anywhere - even in DMs (The sidebar, memberlist, chat, mentions and replies) - presently in a voice call.

Useful for admins/mods of servers to quickly address voicechat behaviour, or to quickly join your friends when they ask you to join their voice channel.
