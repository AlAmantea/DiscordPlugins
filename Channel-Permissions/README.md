# Channel-Permissions
Show what permissions are required for channels by hovering over them. Inspired by and new/updated version of [DevilBro (Mirco Wittrien)'s original](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/ShowHiddenChannels) from the earlier days. Functionality is still in the original but not the experience.

## Known bugs
- Sometimes the tooltip doesn't show when you hover over a channel. But does show after a few tries.
