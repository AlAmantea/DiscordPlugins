# Channel-Permissions
Show what permissions are required for channels by hovering over them. Inspired by and new/updated version of [DevilBro (Mirco Wittrien)'s original](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/ShowHiddenChannels) from the earlier days. Functionality is still in the original but not the experience.

## Latest update:
- Incredible.  It is now as I had envisioned when I started this plugin. If anyone was waiting on this; thank you for your patience and I hope you enjoy!

~~It has been a while since I last messed with this and I have since worked hard to bring a reliable experience. I feel I have now brought it to a good stable state, and would like to share this actually working experience.~~

## What's fixed?
- Everything

## What's left to fix?
- Code optimizations?
But what doesn't need optimizations.
- Overall QoL updates such as text clarity and styling.
