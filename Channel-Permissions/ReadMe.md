# Channel-Permissions
Show what permissions are required for channels by hovering over them. Inspired by and new/updated version of [DevilBro (Mirco Wittrien)'s original](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/ShowHiddenChannels) from the earlier days. Functionality is still in the original but not the experience.

## Known bugs
- When dragging it shows the tooltip as a div under it. This is highly intrusive, working on it.
- When the tooltip scrolls out of bounds, it switches correctly then switches back to ebing out of bounds. This repeats forever. Minor and able to work with, but working on a good calculative system.
